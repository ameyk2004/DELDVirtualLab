## <span id="bcd-to-xs3-converter">Assignment 3</span> - BCD to Excess 3

```
BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) to XS3 (Excess-3) Converter is a digital circuit used to convert Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers into Excess-3 (XS3) code. BCD is a binary representation of decimal numbers, where each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary code. XS3 code, also known as XS-3 or 8421 code, is an excess-3 binary code where each digit is represented by adding 3 to the corresponding BCD code.
```

## <span id="binary-to-gray-code-converter">Assignment 4</span> - Binary to Gray

```
A Binary to Gray Code Converter is a digital circuit used to convert binary numbers into Gray code. Gray code, also known as reflected binary code, is a binary numeral system where successive values differ in only one bit position.
```

## <span id="bcd-adder">Assignment 5</span> - BCD Adder

```
A BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) Adder is a combinational logic circuit used to perform addition operations on Binary Coded Decimal numbers. BCD is a binary representation of decimal numbers, where each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary code. BCD adders take two BCD numbers as input and produce the BCD sum along with a carry output, if applicable.

## <span id="multiplexer">Assignment 6</span> - Multiplexer

```
A Multiplexer, often abbreviated as MUX, is a digital circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. Multiplexers are fundamental components in digital systems used for data routing and signal selection.
```

## <span id="demultiplexer">Assignment 7</span> - Demultiplexer

```
A Demultiplexer, often abbreviated as DEMUX, is a digital circuit that takes a single input and selects one of many possible outputs based on a control signal. Demultiplexers are the inverse of multiplexers and are used for distributing a single input signal to multiple output channels.

## <span id="1-bit-comparator">Assignment 8</span> - 1 Bit Comparator

```
A 1-bit Comparator is a digital circuit used to compare two binary numbers of one bit each and determine their relationship, such as equality, greater than, or less than. It is a fundamental building block in digital systems for decision-making and control logic.
```

## <span id="parity-checker">Assignment 10</span> - Parity Checker

```
A Parity Checker is a digital circuit used to detect errors in binary data transmission by examining the parity of the received data. Parity checking is a method of error detection where an extra bit, known as the parity bit, is added to the data stream. The parity checker compares the received data along with the parity bit and determines whether the transmission is error-free or if errors have occurred during transmission.

## <span id="parity-generator">Assignment 11</span> - Parity Generator

```
A Parity Generator is a digital circuit used to generate parity bits for error detection in binary data transmission. Parity generation involves adding an extra bit, known as the parity bit, to the data stream based on specific rules or algorithms. The resulting data stream with the parity bit reflects a predetermined parity property, such as even parity or odd parity.

Flip Flop Conversion refers to the process of converting one type of flip-flop into another while maintaining its functionality. Flip-flops are fundamental building blocks in digital circuits for storing binary data and maintaining state information. Different types of flip-flops, such as D flip-flops, JK flip-flops, and T flip-flops, have distinct characteristics and applications. Flip-flop conversion techniques allow designers to implement desired functionality using a suitable flip-flop configuration.

## <span id="down-counter">Assignment 14</span> - Down Counter

```
A Down Counter is a digital circuit that counts downwards from an initial value to a final value, following a predetermined sequence. It operates in the opposite manner to an up counter, decrementing its count value with each clock pulse applied to its input. Down counters are commonly used in digital systems for tasks such as countdown timers, event sequencing, and control logic operations.
```

## <span id="up-down-counter">Assignment 15</span> - Up Down Counter

```
An Up-Down Counter is a digital circuit that can count both upwards and downwards, allowing for versatile counting operations in digital systems. Unlike traditional up counters or down counters, which can only count in one direction, up-down counters can alternate between incrementing and decrementing their count value based on a control signal.
```

## <span id="decade-counter">Assignment 16</span> - Decade Counter

```
A Decade Counter is a digital circuit that counts in base-10 (decimal) sequence, typically from 0 to 9, before resetting to 0 and repeating the counting cycle. It is commonly used in digital systems for applications such as frequency division, timekeeping, and event sequencing, where counting in tens is desirable.
```

## <span id="sequence-detector">Assignment 17</span> - Sequence Detector

```
A Sequence Detector is a digital circuit that detects the presence of a specific sequence of binary inputs within a stream of binary data. It is commonly used in digital systems for tasks such as pattern recognition, data parsing, and sequence identification. Sequence detectors analyze the input data stream and generate an output signal when the specified sequence is detected.
```

## <span id="shift-registers">Assignment 18</span> - Shift Registrs

```
Shift registers are digital circuits capable of storing and shifting binary data serially. They consist of a chain of flip-flops connected in series, with each flip-flop storing one bit of the data. Shift registers are widely used in digital systems for tasks such as data storage, serial-to-parallel conversion, parallel-to-serial conversion, and data manipulation.
