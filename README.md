## Description

This project simulates the working of the Digital Electronics Laboratory (DELD) typically found in educational institutions. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can construct and analyze various digital circuits, observe their behavior, and verify theoretical concepts through practical experimentation.

Each experiment in this simulator is designed to cover specific topics in digital electronics, ranging from fundamental logic gates to complex sequential circuits and applications in real-life scenarios. Users can interact with the simulator by designing circuits, inputting signals, and observing the output behavior.

The simulator includes features such as:
- Interactive circuit construction
- Real-time signal visualization
- Simulation controls (start, stop, pause, step)
- Signal waveform analysis tools
- Comprehensive documentation
