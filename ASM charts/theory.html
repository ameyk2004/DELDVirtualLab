        An ASM chart consists of three basic elements : The state box, the
        decision box, and the conditional box.<br />
        <p class="font-bold inline-block mt-4">State box</p>
        <p class="inline">
          : A state in the control sequence is indicated by a state box, as
          shown in the Fig, 8.1.2 As shown in the Fig. 8.1.2, rectangle shape
          is used to represent state box. At the left of this box is the name
          of the state, such as A, B, Qy, Qy- On the right hand top comer of
          the box is a list of the flip-flop values that define that state.
          The circuit outputs that can occur whenever the circuit is in the
          corresponding state regardless of input values are listed within the
          box. Finally, a line drawn from state box, known as exit, indicates
          the path to the next state

      <p class="font-bold inline-block mt-4 text-2xl">Decision box</p>
      <p class="inline text-2xl">
        The decision box describes the effect of an input on the control subsystem. It has a diamond shape box with two
        or more exit paths, as shown in the fig 8.1.3. The input condition to be tested is written inside the diamond
        box. Each value either 0 or 1 that may be assumed by an input or expression in a diamond is associated with an
        exit path from that diamond. These paths lead to the blocks corresponding to the next states of the circuit
        following the next clock pulse.

      <p class="font-bold inline-block mt-4 text-2xl">Conditional box</p>
      <p class="inline text-2xl">
        The state and decision boxes are familiar from use in conventional flowcharts. The third basic element, the
        conditional box, is unique to the ASM chart. It is an oval shape box. Its rounded corners differentiate it from
        the state box. The input path for the conditional box always comes from one of the exit paths of a decision box.
        The outputs that occur when the path to a conditional output box is satisfied are listed within the box.

      <ol class="text-2xl mb-12" type="i">
        <span class="font-bold">1. </span>An ASM chart describes the sequence of events as well as the timing
        relationship
        between the states of a sequential controller and the events that occur while going
        from one state to the next.<br>

        <span class="font-bold">2. </span>Every block in an ASM chart specifies the operations that are to be performed
        during
        one common clock pulse.<br>

        <span class="font-bold">3. </span>The operations specified within the state and conditional boxes in the block
        are
        performed in the datapath subsystem.<br>

        <span class="font-bold">4. </span>The change from one state to next is performed in the control subsystem.
        An ASM chart consists of one or more interconnected blocks.<br>

        <span class="font-bold">5. </span>An ASM block has one entrance and any number of exit paths represented by the
        structure of the decision boxes.<br>

        <span class="font-bold">6. </span>Each block in the ASM chart describes the state of the system during one
        clock-pulse
        interval. When a digital system enters the state associated with a given ASM block,
        the outputs indicated within the state box becomes true. The conditions associated
        with the decision boxes are evaluated to determine which path or paths to be
        followed to enter into the next ASM block.<br>
