    <h3>THEORY :</h3>
    <p>
        Binary Adder and subtractor are a combinational logic circuit which is used to perform
binary addition and subtraction .Full adder is a little more difficult to implement than a
half-adder. The full-adder has three inputs and two outputs. The first two inputs are A and
B and the third input is an input carry designated as CIN. When full adder logic is designed
we will be able to string eight of them together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade
the carry bit from one adder to the next
The full subtractor is a combinational circuit with three inputs A,B,C and two output D and
C'. A is the 'minuend', B is 'subtrahend', C is the 'borrow' produced by the previous stage,
D is the difference output and C' is the borrow output.
