                    <p>
                        A Parity Checker is a digital circuit that examines the parity of an incoming data stream to ensure data integrity during transmission. It verifies whether the received data has the correct parity according to the specified scheme, either even or odd.

                    <h3>Even Parity Checker</h3>
                    <p>
                        Consider that three input message along with even parity bit is generated at the transmitting end. These 4 bits are applied as input to the parity checker circuit, which checks the possibility of error on the data. Since the data is transmitted with even parity, four bits received at circuit must have an even number of 1s.<br><br>

If any error occurs, the received message consists of odd number of 1s. The output of the parity checker is denoted by PEC (Parity Error Check).<br><br>

The below table shows the truth table for the Even Parity Checker in which PEC = 1 if the error occurs, i.e., the four bits received have odd number of 1s and PEC = 0 if no error occurs, i.e., if the 4-bit message has even number of 1s.<br><br>

                    <h3>Odd Parity Checker</h3>
                    <p>
                        Consider that a three bit message along with odd parity bit is transmitted at the transmitting end. Odd parity checker circuit receives these 4 bits and checks whether any error are present in the data.<br><br>

If the total number of 1s in the data is odd, then it indicates no error, whereas if the total number of 1s is even then it indicates the error since the data is transmitted with odd parity at transmitting end.<br><br>

The below figure shows the truth table for odd parity generator where PEC =1 if the 4-bit message received consists of even number of 1s (hence the error occurred) and PEC= 0 if the message contains odd number of 1s (that means no error).<br><br>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, Parity Checkers are essential components in data communication systems, providing a mechanism for error detection. Whether using even or odd parity, these circuits enhance data reliability by verifying the correctness of the received data based on its parity characteristics.
